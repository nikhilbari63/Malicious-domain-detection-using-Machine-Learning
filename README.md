# Malicious-domain-detection-using-Machine-Learning

This repository contains code and resources for detecting malicious domains using machine learning techniques. Malicious domains are often used for various nefarious activities such as phishing, malware distribution, and other cyber attacks. This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model that can accurately classify domains as malicious or benign based on various features.

Overview
The project consists of the following components:
1.Data Collection: Gathering domain data from various sources.
2.Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for training.
3.Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features from domain data.
4.Model Training: Developing and training machine learning models.
5.Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained models.
6.Deployment: Integrating the model into a practical application.

Usage
Data Collection: Collect domain data from various sources. This step can be performed using web scraping tools or by obtaining datasets from publicly available repositories.
Data Preprocessing: Clean the collected data and prepare it for feature extraction and model training. This may involve tasks such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the domain data. Features may include domain length, presence of hyphens or numbers, and frequency of certain characters,and whois Features
Model Training: Develop and train machine learning models using the preprocessed data. Experiment with different algorithms such as Logistics Regreassion and Gradient Boosting.
Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Tune hyperparameters to improve model performance if necessary.
Deployment: Integrate the trained model into a practical application for real-time malicious domain detection. 

Results
Rresult pages can be used for further analysis or as additional features for model training. The frontend search page can help visualize how users interact with domain search functionality, ![search page](https://github.com/nikhilbari63/Malicious-domain-detection-using-Machine-Learning/assets/160225662/a36f8020-34dd-4962-a2d6-ea4e29dbe493)

while the result pages can provide insights into the domains searched and their associated features.![beign output](https://github.com/nikhilbari63/Malicious-domain-detection-using-Machine-Learning/assets/160225662/234ca4b3-c25b-415f-a074-54bc887d21c0)
